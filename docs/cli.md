# Command-Line Interface references

There are two command-line programs for interacting with Relay. Their auto-generated documentation is stored here for reference.

* Use the main [Relay CLI](/docs/cli/relay.md) for interacting with the service to manage workflows and integrations.
* Use the ["ni" utility](/docs/cli/ni.md) inside step containers for accessing workflow metadata, passing data between steps, and generating persistent log messages from a step.
